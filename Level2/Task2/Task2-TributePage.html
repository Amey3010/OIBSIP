                <h1>&nbsp;EARLY LIFE&nbsp;</h1>
                <p>Kentaro Miura was born on July 11<sup>th</sup>, 1966 in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan to two artists who were students at Musashino Arts School. His father created storyboards for commericals and his mother was an art teacher, which resulted in a naturally constructed artistic environment that inspired him to draw. Thus, in 1973, he began experimenting with drawing in a notebook.<br><br>
                From the very young age of 10 years old in 1976, he created his first manga for his schoolmates in a school publication, called Miuranger, which spanned 40 total volumes. However, this was never published in any official formats, so original artwork and storyline is unknown. In fact, one image is commonly mistakened to be from Miuranger, but is actually from his one-shot post-apocalyptic story, Noa.</p>

                <h1>&nbsp;HIS MANGA CARRIER&nbsp;</h1>
                <p>The best manga ever, Berserk, first appeared in 1988. This version is what we now call Berserk: The Prototype - a 48 paged manga that won Miura a prize from a Manga School.Not long after this, he finished his doctorate in 1989 and began another manga called Ourou, otherwise known as King of the Wolves.<br>
                    In 1990, there were more releases to follow up on Ourou called Ourou Den (Legend of the Wolf King). That same year, Japanese Animal House also released the first ever publication of Berserk, which did not begin to gain traction until the Golden Age Arc.<br>
                    In 1992, he started the manga Japan with Okamura, which appeared in Animal House that year with stand alone manga volumes released the following year.</p>

            <div class="aboutText">
                <p style="margin-top: 50px;">However, it was toward the end of this year that Miura decided to dedicate himself to continuing his manga, Berserk. Later on, due to Berserk's popularity, Miura would eventually manage the production of the 25 episode animated series for Berserk in 1997.<br>
                    Presently, Berserk, which is my favourite, has had a lot of success in Japan and around the world. It has released 40 volumes and has earned Miura the Award for Excellence at the 6th installment of the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize- winning him a total of 1 million yen.<br>
                    In 2013, Miura wrote and illustrated another manga named Gigantomakhia, a 6 chapter mini-seies.</p>

                <h1>&nbsp;HIS DEATH & LEGACY&nbsp;</h1>
                <p>On May 6, 2021, Miura died due to acute aortic dissection, at the age of 54. His death was publicly announced on May 20, 2021. A private ceremony was held by his family.<br>
                    Established as one of the best-selling manga of all time, Miura's series Berserk impacted the manga medium and beyond, with journalist Jade King stating: "[It] is difficult to overstate the tremendous impact his work has had on the world of games, manga, film, anime, and even literature."<br>
                    Many authors have cited Miura and Berserk as influences.<br>
                    The 2021 18th issue of Young Animal, released on September 10, 2021, was a "memorial" to Miura. Besides the inclusion of the posthumous chapter 364 of Berserk, the issue featured a special "Messages to Kentarou Miura". In the issue, manga artist Kōji Mori, Miura's long-time friend, published a one-shot titled "Mori-chan Ken-chan", which tells the story of Mori's friendship with Miura.</p>
